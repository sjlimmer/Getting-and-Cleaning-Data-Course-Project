The file run_analysis.R contains all of the analysis code. The steps invloved were:

I have combined the two data sets (test and training), including both the data files (X_test.txt and X_train.txt), the labels
(y_test.txt and y_train.txt) and the subjects (subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt). This was done by using cbind 
to join the data, labels and subjects for each set (test and train), then using rbind to join the test and train sets into a single
merged dataframe.

All column names containing the substrings 'mean' or 'std' were subsetted out using grepl. The intent is that the 'mean' coulmns
contain the mean for each measurement and the 'std' columns contain the standard deviation for each measurement..

The activities in this merged data set were given descriptive activity names based on the activity_labels.txt file. This file
was read into a second dataframe, which was then combined with the merged data above, merging on the activity number.

Activity names were taken from the file features.txt. A more detailed description of what
each variable means is included below.

The tidy data set was created by using aggregate to take the mean of each variable for each of the six activity types and each
subject.

The variable name details are as follows:
